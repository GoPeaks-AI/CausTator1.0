# CausTator1.0
CausTator (Causality Annotator) 1.0 is free annotation software for users who have no programming background. The annotated documents can be used directly for most Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. CausTator 1.0 works on any IE browser at a local computer environment, which protects privacy of the annotated documents.  It automatically detects sentences from textual documents based on a user-defined list of trigger words and stop words, then allows users to tag phrases within these sentences such as causes and outcomes, and finally produces the annotated document for downloads.
